        <h1> GUIDELINES </h1>
        <p> I'm not good at love letters nor am I good at making gifts on my own. It might not be as good as you think.
            There are some flaws here and there but I hope you still appreciate the work!
            This is hosted on GitHub and you have access to the source code, but I'll still put the effort to tell you these: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> You're allowed to view the html, script, and style, but KEEP OFF the entries. </li>
            <li> In case you missed a day, you can view all the entries by the end of the month... hopefully! </li>
            <li> There may be some topics too sensitive for other people, so view these on your own.</li>
            <li> I WILL talk a lot. And I MIGHT share a bit much. I just hope it's not too much. </li>
            <li> I love you! <b> Happy Valentines! </b> I love you so so soooo much. </li>
        </ul>

        <p> I'll try to give updates here if there are any recent changes! I love you! </p>
        <!-- I can see you -->
